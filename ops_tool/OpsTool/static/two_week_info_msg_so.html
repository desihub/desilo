<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are signed up to observe for DESI as an Support Observing Scientist (SO). Thank you for participating in our observing program!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are signed up for the first SO shift, your observing shift will begin with the Afternoon Planning meeting at 5pm MST. Following the 5pm meeting, you will be responsible for starting the Afternoon Spectrograph Calibrations. Those will likely start at 5:15pm MST. Your Lead Observer will tell you when to sign on for the night observing, approximately 30 minutes prior to 12 degree twilight (find Kitt Peak ephemeris <a href="https://www.noao.edu/kpno/skycal/cal2021.html"><span class="s2">here</span></a>). Your shift will run until 12:15am MST.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are signed up for the second SO shift, your observing night will begin at 11:45pm MST and run until observing ends, at approximately 12 degree twilight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are a new or inexperienced observer it is a requirement that you join the observing team for ~1 hour on the night prior to your official shift. Please plan for this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You will use this Zoom channel to connect to the afternoon meeting and connect with the observing team throughout the night: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/9164710534?pwd=ZTFBSGpWUEFCNEJiY3JVZ2kxSFhzdz09</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DESI is a complex instrument and we want the observing to proceed smoothly and efficiently.
