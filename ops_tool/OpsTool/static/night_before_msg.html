<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>It is essential that you have verified that your VPN account is active.</b> If you have observed in the past your credentials are unchanged. If you are a new observer please ensure that you have notified Noirlab staff that you have changed your password from the one that was automatically generated. This process is not automatic so please ensure you do this well in advance of your shift starting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>If you are a new, or inexperience observer it is required that you join the observing team for ~1 hour on the night prior to your shift. </b>This will allow you to obtain the relevant account passwords from the lead observer and verify that your system is set up correctly. If you are not a new observer you are encouraged, but not required to join the night prior to your shift. There is no need to schedule this, please just join at whatever time is convenient and introduce yourself to the lead observer. The observing team can be viewed at: https://obsschedule.desi.lbl.gov/OpsViewer</span></p>
