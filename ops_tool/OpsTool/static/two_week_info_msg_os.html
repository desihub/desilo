<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are signed up to observe for DESI as an Observing Scientist (OS). Thank you for participating in our observing program!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are signed up for the first OS shift, your observing shift will begin with the Afternoon Planning meeting at 5pm MST. Following the 5pm meeting, you will be responsible for starting the Afternoon Spectrograph Calibrations if they have not already started. Those will likely start at 5:15pm MST. Your Lead Observer will tell you when to sign on for the night observing, approximately 30 minutes prior to 12 degree twilight (find Kitt Peak ephemeris <a href="https://www.noao.edu/kpno/skycal/cal2021.html"><span class="s2">here</span></a>). Your shift will run until 12:15am MST.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are signed up for the second OS shift you observing shift will begin at 11:45pm MST and run until observing ends, at approximately 12 degree twilight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You will use this Zoom channel to connect to the afternoon meeting and throughout the night observing: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/9164710534?pwd=ZTFBSGpWUEFCNEJiY3JVZ2kxSFhzdz09</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before starting your observing shift, please review the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=4224"><span class="s2">DESI Code of Conduct</span></a>. You will be interacting with both NOIRLab staff and DESI Collaboration members during your shift, please act with respect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DESI is a complex instrument and we want the observing to proceed smoothly and efficiently. As the OS, you will be responsible for:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">monitoring the progress of observing</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">monitoring the weather conditions and image quality</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">writing the nightly log (and recording the observing, observing conditions, and any problems)</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">helping the Lead Observing Scientist (LOS) monitor the telemetry from the instrument.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The first OS observer will be responsible for running <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/Calibrations#AfternoonCalibrations"><span class="s2">Spectrograph Calibrations</span></a> following the Afternoon Meeting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In preparation for your upcoming shift, please review the all materials relevant to the OS on the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NewObserverTraining"><span class="s2">Observer Training wiki page</span></a>. The day prior to your shift you will receive a reminder email with a pre-observing checklist. By that time you will be expected to have reviewed all training materials.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please let us know in advance if you have any questions. It might be helpful for you to participate in observing for a couple hours on a night prior to your run, particularly if this is your first shift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is also useful to start attending the daily planning meeting one night before the start of your actual shift<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We thank you for helping us with the DESI observing. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.</span></p>
